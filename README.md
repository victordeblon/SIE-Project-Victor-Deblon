# Precipitation Sublimation Analysis in Switzerland
## Overview
This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks for the scientific project "Precipitation Sublimation in Switzerland". The study focuses on the analysis of virga events—instances where precipitation sublimates before reaching the ground—using data from the Payerne measurement station, QPE data and radiosoundings from MeteoSwiss.

## Files
**1 - Data Handling and Visualization.ipynb:** This notebook is dedicated to initial data processing and visualization. It covers data cleaning, organization, and the creation of preliminary visual representations of the study's meteorological data.

**2 - Large Scope Analysis.ipynb**: This notebook delves into a broad analysis of virga events, examining their frequency, intensity, and seasonal distribution. It employs various statistical methods to classify and understand these atmospheric phenomena.

**3 - Narrow Scope Analysis and Vertical Profile Descriptors.ipynb:** This notebook provides a detailed analysis of specific virga events, including an examination of vertical atmospheric profiles. It offers in-depth insights into the atmospheric conditions associated with virga.

**4 - Case Studies:** This notenook digs deeper into the precipitation observed at surrounding stations on the days of three selected events analysed as case studies. 

## Study Summary
The study investigates the occurrence of virga events, a phenomenon where precipitation evaporates or sublimates before reaching the ground, leading to significant meteorological implications. By utilizing station measurements, QPE products, and radiosonde data, this research aims to understand the frequency, intensity, and seasonal patterns of virga events in Switzerland.
