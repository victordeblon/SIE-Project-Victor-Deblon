# Precipitation Sublimation Analysis in Switzerland
## Overview
This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks for the scientific project "Precipitation Sublimation in Switzerland". The study focuses on the analysis of virga events—instances where precipitation sublimates before reaching the ground—using data from the Payerne measurement station in Switzerland.

## Study Summary
The study investigates the occurrence of virga events, a phenomenon where precipitation evaporates or sublimates before reaching the ground, leading to significant meteorological implications. By utilizing station measurements, QPE products, and radiosonde data, this research aims to understand the frequency, intensity, and seasonal patterns of virga events in Switzerland.
